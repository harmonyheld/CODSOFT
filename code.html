             <p>"Way and Soul" could be seen as a reminder to stay true to oneself and one's values while navigating the ups and downs of life. It may also suggest that one's spiritual or inner life is just as important as one's outer experiences and achievements.</p>
             <p>Way and Soul is a community that publishes smart takes and well-reported stories about South Asia and South Asians. We call it “smart journalism for the South Asian diaspora” though we welcome all readers who are curious about our stories.</p>
             <p>We are starting with one new story every weekday and cover everything from politics to culture to tech. Our goal is to celebrate our heritage but also challenge and unlearn what our history books and community have gotten wrong.</p>
             <p>We are thoughtful in everything we do from choosing fonts created by South Asians to welcoming beginner blogers and writers and also illustrators responsibly.</p>
