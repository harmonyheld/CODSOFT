				<p>The Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC) is a first-of-its-kind venue for the arts, which opened its doors in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex in October 2022. It promises to be a significant cultural monument which is dedicated to Nita M. Ambani, a businesswoman, philanthropist and longtime supporter of the arts.</p>
				<p>The Jio World Centre, which is in the centre of India's financial and entertainment hub, is where the NMACC is located as well. It houses the nation's largest conference centre, retail hospitality establishments and more. The three-story structure will include facilities for both visual and performing arts. The Grand Theatre, The Studio Theatre and The Cube are three specifically designed performance venues. They were all built with cutting-edge technology to accommodate a variety of experiences, from private screenings and thought-provoking discussions to multilingual programming and international productions. The centre will also open The Art House, a four-story facility that will feature prominent artists from India and around the world.</p>
