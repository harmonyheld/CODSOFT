				<p>On the evening of February 5, 2023, just before the curtains went up on the Grammy Awards stage, Cardi B hit the red carpet. With a seductive saunter, well aware of the countless cameras flashing her way, the rapper and fashion icon stunned in a sculptural electric blue gown that wrapped around her like a wisp of smoke as if she’d just magically appeared. Harper’s Bazaar dubbed it “actual art,” while Glamour declared she’d “won” the carpet. As many tweeted, “Cardi B ate.” Indeed she did. </p>
        <p>TDespite designer Gaurav Gupta’s already illustrious nearly two-decade career, the moment also marked the West’s awareness of Gupta. So caught off guard was the glitterati that Vogue mistakenly labeled the custom-made dress a Mugler.</p>
        <p>But Delhi-based Gupta, 44, has dressed various celebrities before: Megan Thee Stallion at the Oscars, Aishwarya Rai at Cannes, Mary J. Blige at the TIME 100 Gala, Iman Vellani at the Ms. Marvel premiere. Gupta’s first show at Paris Couture Week in 2022, however, propelled the brand onto a global stage and made Gupta an incredibly wanted figure in fashion. And he plans to stay there.</p>
