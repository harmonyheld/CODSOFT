				<p>“For culture to be relevant it needs to be dynamic," says Sabyasachi Mukherjee. And his latest store in Mumbai, which opens later today, is an actualisation of this vision. The Indian designer’s largest flagship yet, the store is sprawled over 25,000 sq ft and housed in the majestic neo-classical landmark built in the Italianate revival tradition. Consider the space is a living museum of sorts– where interiors are reimagined into an immersive retail space that merges cultural savoir-faire with craftsmanship and history.</p>

        <p>Layered between antique paintings and historical trinkets some from his own collectables are over 100 chandeliers, 275 carpets, 3,000 books and 150 works of art created by the Sabyasachi Foundation. The attention to detail is such that the space is lined with curiosity cabinets sourced from souks, modernist interpretations of Persian Qajars, 18th-century Venetian handcrafted chairs, rare French Art Nouveau cabinets and arrogant brass sculptures made in his hometown Calcutta. Standing inside the space feels like stepping inside the mind of the couturier himself–an eclectic casual existence of glamour and slow authentic luxury taking over one's senses.</p>
        <p>The ground floor holds the Sabyasachi bridal collection. The first floor is dedicated to the brand’s largest showcase of jewellery in the world, housing fine, heritage and high jewellery collections. And the second floor is home to womenswear, menswear, the international collection, and Sabyasachi's accessories. Hidden lounges and dens dot each floor, with a tearoom tucked away behind silk velvet drapes, which offers guests a moment of pause with a curated list of Sabyasachi’s favourite blends. As expected from his artistic mind, the designer has not only blended fashion and art seamlessly via another antiquarian store but also curated an experiential walk-in for his clients.</p>
