				<h2>How a Portuguese Technique Led to a Bengali Sondesh Explosion</h2>
				<p>Nearly 500 years ago, the Portuguese popularized milk curdling in Bengal. Bengalis would add sweetness and create a rich delicacy.</p>

				<p>Although it is the syrupy Banglar rasogolla that has won the coveted Geographical Indication (GI) tag — a marker that ensures a food product has a specific geographical origin — it is the ubiquitous sondesh whose versatility Bengalis have exploited for the past five centuries. In a typical sweetshop, sondesh occupies more than half the shelf space — though its history is far murkier than that of the rosogolla. They are crafted as conch-shells, sculpted as ornate swans, or shaped into simple spheres. Some are crumbly, meant to be consumed in a day. The dense ones would be good for a week. It doesn’t matter which one you bite; your tongue will thank you anyway.</p>    
        <p>Long before the sondesh, pellets of sweetened khoa, or milk condensed over heat, were common desserts in the subcontinent, including West Bengal. “We had sondesh for a very long time, but it used to be made with either coconut or thickened milk, or lentils and jaggery. The name [sondesh] comes from its usage for sending good news,” said Pritha Sen, a food historian. Krishnadas Kaviraj mentioned this early iteration of sondesh in his Bengali book Chaitanyacharitamrita, set between the years 1486 to 1534. </p>

        <p>Sondesh today, in contrast, uses curdled milk instead of khoa. And though the dessert is enmeshed with Bengali identity, it is an artifact of the Portuguese colonies in West Bengal — a remnant of one of the subcontinent’s very first interactions with the Western world.</p>
