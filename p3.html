				<p>There was something quite mind-blowing about the whole experience of being present at Maria Grazia Chuiri’s introduction to India—or rather, to her making visible all of the many ways that Christian Dior is interlinked with the artisanship centred in Mumbai. One moment, you were taking in the epic scale of a show on the harbour, silhouetted against the Gateway of India landmark, with a runway flanked by a carpet of multicoloured flowers. And the next, your retinas were being irradiated by the microscopic ingenuity of Indian traditional handcrafts sparkling—all-over mirrored Rajasthani embroidered mini-dresses were part of it—under a revelatory spotlight.</p>
				<p>Earlier in the day, the creative director of Christian Dior womenswear sat chatting with Karishma Swali, the artistic director of Chanakya Ateliers, where all of the intricacies of the insanely detailed haute couture textiles are magicked up for the Paris maison. The two have a deep-rooted professional friendship that’s been going on “for almost 30 years,” laughed Chiuri. They first got to know each other as far back as 1992, when Chiuri began travelling to Mumbai to work on embroideries with Chanakya when she was designing accessories at Fendi. Together, since Chiuri began at Christian Dior, she and Swali have pushed both for the visibly spectacular and the feminist and ethical—on the one hand, the production of the vast textile murals commissioned from women artists that decorate the walls of Dior couture shows in Paris, and on the other, the establishment in 2015 of the Chanakya Foundation school which educates women in crafts and opportunities in a largely male-dominated field.</p>
                <p>Paying it forward for the independence of India’s diverse communities of women and girls is clearly one of the greatest satisfactions for Chiuri and Swali. Observing them, it’s obvious that it’s one of the bases of an eye-to-eye connection that’s gone much deeper than the typical transactional relationship of client and supplier. But they also simply share a common delight in the work—the magical textiles—that they can endlessly create that have never exactly existed before. “The idea is also to be able to mix techniques. It’s really teamwork,” Chiuri exclaimed, glancing at the friend and collaborator she knows so well. “It’s not even conscious for us,” she laughed. “It’s playing.”</p>
